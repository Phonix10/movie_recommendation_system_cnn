# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using CNN

This project implements a *movie recommendation system* using *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* and content-based filtering. It utilizes movie poster images and genre metadata to recommend visually and contextually similar movies.

## 🧠 Features

- Content-based recommendations using visual features
- Trained CNN model to extract image embeddings
- Cosine similarity-based recommendation engine
- Simple UI built with Streamlit

## 📁 Project Structure

## ⚙ How It Works

1. *Train a CNN* to learn visual features from movie poster images.
2. *Extract feature vectors* and save them using numpy.
3. *Calculate cosine similarity* between feature vectors to find similar movies.
4. *Streamlit app* allows users to interact and view recommended movies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
